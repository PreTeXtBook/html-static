# PreTeXt and Runestone CSS and Javascript files for CDN

This repository exists only to serve css and javascript files via jsdelivr's CDN.  These files are used when *portable* html is built to limit the number of files that must be copied by an author.

Everything is automatic; on any deployment of the CLI an action will trigger this repository to commit fresh versions of the files with a new tag.
